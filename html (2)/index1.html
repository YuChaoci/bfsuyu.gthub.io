                <div align="center"><img src="img/makecoffee.jpg" width="500"/></div>
                <h3>Americano</h3>
                <p>With a similar flavor to black coffee, the americano consists of an espresso shot diluted in hot water. Pro tip: if you’re making your own, pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.</p>
                <p>美式咖啡=黑咖啡/浓缩咖啡+水</p>
                <h3>Latte</h3>
                <p>As the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to pumpkin spice. (Here's how to make a copycat Starbucks pumpkin spice latte.)</p>
                <p>拿铁咖啡=浓缩咖啡+牛奶
                    <p>意式拿铁=牛奶+咖啡</p>
                    <p>美式拿铁=奶泡+咖啡</p>
                <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
                <p>Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.</p>
                <p>卡布奇诺=使用1/3意式浓缩+1/3蒸汽牛奶+1/3泡沫牛奶
                    <p><i>卡布奇诺口味比拿铁重一些，由于颜色很像卡布奇诺教会修士的深色道袍而得名。</i></p>
                <h3>Espresso</h3>
                <p>An espresso shot can be served solo or used as the foundation of most coffee drinks, like lattes and macchiatos. </p>
                <p>意式浓缩咖啡：用蒸汽或热水通过研磨很细的咖啡粉压煮而成的咖啡。
                <p>这种制作方法是让水"压过"咖啡,非常迅速,espresso 又非常接近英语单词express（迅速的）.所以,经常会听到有人称这种饮料为 expresso.</p>
                <h3>Mocha</h3>
                <p>For all you chocolate lovers out there, you’ll fall in love with a mocha (or maybe you already have). The mocha is a chocolate espresso drink with steamed milk and foam.</p>
                <p>摩卡咖啡=浓缩咖啡+巧克力酱+鲜奶油+牛奶</p>
                <h3>Flat White</h3>
                <p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a glossy or velvety consistency).</p>
                <p>澳洲白咖啡（馥芮白、醇艺白、小白咖啡）=奶泡+牛奶+浓缩咖啡</p>
